## Results
If you are interested in looking at the maps check out the website: http://redistrict.science.

## Redistrict a State
```run.py``` is the main script to run.
It downloads (if required) and processes relevant data for a state.
Afterwards it runs the clustering on the state.
And finally, it graphs the state as it is and the results of the clustering.
For more information type:
```bash
python run.py --help
```
## Examples
For a simple and easy state to run (not super taxing on RAM, etc.), you may try Rhode Island.
Type the following and hit return:
```
python run.py RI
```

The ```run.py``` will now print information to do with the files it will create and the settings it is being run with.
